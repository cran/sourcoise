Description: Provides a function that behaves nearly as base::source() but
    implements a caching mechanism on disk, project based.  It allows to
    quasi source() R scripts that gather data but can fail or consume to
    much time to respond even if nothing new is expected.  It comes with
    tools to check and execute on demand or when cache is invalid the
    script.
